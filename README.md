# Mastering DynamicSQL

Abstract: 
Dynamic SQL has a bad reputation. Some of it is even deserved. However, dynamic SQL can be a great tool to have in your toolbox when used correctly.

In this session, we'll dive into creating and troubleshooting dynamic SQL syntax. We will start by examining various scenarios that would be good candidates for implementation. Then we'll take a look at how it executes under the covers. We'll discuss ways of smarter and safer ways of crafting our SQL statements. And of course, we will discuss various ways to debug the statements as well as add error handling.

You will leave this session with a better understanding and appreciation for how dynamic SQL works as well as why and when to use it
